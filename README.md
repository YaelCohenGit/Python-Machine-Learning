# Python Machine Learning

This project demonstrates the implementation of **machine learning algorithms and techniques** using Python. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and fine-tuning, with a focus on practical applications of machine learning.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handle missing values, normalize data, and feature engineering.
  - Prepare datasets for training machine learning models.

- **Model Training**:
  - Implement and train supervised and unsupervised learning models.
  - Utilize algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, clustering, and more.

- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves.
  - Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize models.

- **Visualization**:
  - Generate visual insights into data and model performance.
